Sun Peaks Freestyle Club has been in operation for 4 years.  We are a club dedicated 
to promoting Freestyle skiing in the Kamloops / Sun Peaks areas.  The club while 
still small has been growing with each year of operation.  We are hoping for the 
2017 season to have 30-40 athelets registered with the club.  If you are interested
in participation please email sunpeaksfreestyleclub@gmail.com with some basic 
information about you, (Age, Sex, How long you've been skiing for)
