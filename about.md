Sun Peaks Freestyle Club has been in operation for 4 years.  We are a club dedicated 
to promoting Freestyle skiing in the Kamloops / Sun Peaks areas.  The club while 
still small has been growing with each year of operation.  We are hoping for the 
2017/2018 season to have 30-40 athelets registered with the club.  If you are interested
in participation please refer to the [registration page](../registration/)
