# Registration for Sun Peaks Freestyle Club
We are super excited to have you join our club.  Our club is independent from the Sun Peaks
Ski School, and the locals program that they offer.  Hopefully this site and the following information
will provide you with any information you need about our club.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to

The following describes our membership requirements and what you need to do in order to join the club.  

## Age Cutoff
For the 2018-2019 ski season the age cut off is for kids born in **2008 or prior**.
