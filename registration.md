# Registration for Sun Peaks Freestyle Club
We are super excited to have you join our club.  Our club is independent from the Sun Peaks
Ski School, and the locals program that they offer.  Hopefully this site and the following information
will provide you with any information you need about our club.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to 
contact us at <sunpeaksfreestyleclub@gmail.com>.  

The following describes our membership requirements and what you need to do in order to join the club.  

## BC Freestyle Membership
Before you can register with our club you will need to register with BC 
Freestyle which can be done here: 
[https://freestylebc.ski/join/](https://freestylebc.ski/join/)

Options are:
  * CANFREE 1&2 - $63 
  * CANFREE 3   - $137
  
If you are not sure which one you should choose the chances are its the first one (_CANFREE 1&2_)  The other option is 
primarily for Timber Tour atheletes.


## Club Registration

### Coaching Fees

**Now:** $800 for 14 days of regular training at Sun Peaks

**Later:** $150 per competition attended (all are optional)

### Schedule

If your child was born in:

 **2005 or earlier** *(will be age 13 or greater as of Dec 31/2018)*, they will train on **Saturdays, 9am-3pm.**


**2006/2007/2008** (will be age 10/11/12 as of Dec 31/2018), they will train on **Sundays, 9am-3pm.**


**2009 or later** *(will be age 9 or less as of Dec 31/2018)*, they will train on **Saturdays, 9am-3pm.**



Training will begin on the weekend of **December 1/2** and end on the weekend of **March 30/31** with no days off over Christmas or March break.  This covers a period of 18 weekends, 14 of which will be regular training at Sun Peaks (covered by the $800 base coaching fee), and 4 of which will be competitions elsewhere (there is a coaching fee of $150 per competition, but there is no obligation to attend any competitions).

Unfortunately, we do not yet know the exact competition schedule, just that there will be 4 events: most likely, these will take place:
  - [Apex: Jan 17-20](https://freestylebc.ski/event/timber-tour-apex-2019/)
  - [Mt. Washington: Feb 8-10](https://freestylebc.ski/event/timber-tour-mt-washington-2/)
  - [Big White: Mar 16-18](https://freestylebc.ski/event/big-white-slopestyle-2019/)
  - [Silver Star: Mar 29-31](https://freestylebc.ski/event/timber-tour-silver-star/)

The first of these will be in January and the fourth will be in March or the beginning of April, but that's really all we can say right now.  Details should be finalized by Freestyle BC within the next month or two.

# Uniforms

Uniforms are optional, but if you want to order one, you will need to place your order at the same time as you register (see below).  We can't provide a lot of information about the new uniforms other than to say that they are similar, but not identical, to the ones we've ordered in the past.  

Uniform pricing (which includes both jacket and pants, as well as embroidery) is as follows:
 - Youth: $195
 - Men: $325
 - Women: $375
(*The price difference between men and women is due to them being from different product lines.*)

### Sizing charts are available on the following pages:

  - **Youth**: <https://www.orage.com/us/sizecharts/kids/>
  - **Men:** <https://www.orage.com/us/sizecharts/men/>
  - **Women:** <https://www.orage.com/us/sizecharts/women/>

## Registration and Payment

To register, please fill out the following form for EACH child you want to register:
<https://goo.gl/forms/qYYzek1aPHgKBBJo2>

After you fill out this form, you will be emailed an invoice, which you must pay by eTransfer within **7 days** of the invoice being sent to you.  Please note that the Sun Peaks ski school is not involved in registration whatsoever this year, so you cannot pay your fees through them.

Registration will be done on a first-come, first-served basis.  We only have a limited number of spaces, and will have to close registration once we fill them.  Also, we must place our uniform order by **October 12th**, so please ensure you register well before then if you would like a uniform!
